{"name":"SqlServerDevOps","tagline":"DevOps for MS SQL Server","body":"## Welcome to SQL Server DevOps\r\nThe purpose of this project is to develop a set of PowerShell scripts that allow you to use XML files to define the configuration you want for MS SQL Server instances. This allows you to put your configuration of your SQL Servers under version control with all the associated befits. You can then use the scripts push that configuration to your servers.\r\n\r\nNote: This project is just getting started. Contribution be they in the form of new scripts, patches, bug reports, suggestions for new features or just kind words of encouragement are welcomed. This project, like many is to scratch and itch I've had and maybe it can be of use to you too.   \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell Community Extensions ([PSCX](https://pscx.codeplex.com/)) module is required. The PSCX module needs to be found under the [PSModulePath](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd878326(v=vs.85).aspx) environment variable.\r\n\r\n### Installation \r\n\r\n1. Download the latest version of the scripts using the buttons to the right.\r\n1. Unzip in your choice of location\r\n\r\nNote: Not sure if there are issues with signing scripts and the like. If you have issues let me know or log a bug [here](https://github.com/ebh/SQLServerDevOps/issues/new).\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nAfter that you can run one of the following scripts:\r\n\r\n* SQLAgentDeployer.ps1 - Will configure a SQL Agent Instance\r\n* SQLRefreshEnviroment.ps1 - Used to refresh a non-production environment from backups (Not yet fully implemented)\r\n* SQLReplicationDeployer.ps1 - Will configure SQL Replication (Not yet fully implemented)\r\n\r\nGot an idea for another script? What about you drop me a line?\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by Alex Dess (@ebh) who is currently looking for contributors in any shape or form.\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this scripts?
